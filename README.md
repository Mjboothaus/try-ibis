[Ibis Project - Expressive analytics in Python at any scale](https://ibis-project.org/)

Ibis provides a more Pythonic way of interacting with multiple database engines. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those of us who prefer to write python code over SQL strings. Anything you can write in a select statement you can write in Ibis. 


Features include:
* Pandas-like semantically complete data expression system that covers even such relational data concepts as self-joins, window functions, correlated and uncorrelated sub-queries.
* High level analytics tools like bucketing, top-k, histogram, and value_counts.
